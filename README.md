Abstract:

An unconventional Otome game that follows the RoboMaster's storyline.

A student is drafted into a school's new robotics club. 

They meet the other students in the club, form bonds,

friends, enemies, and eventually take part in a local 

robotics tournament.

Decision Branching follows a path that yields "upgrades" 

e.g.

Chuuni and Gutsy are arguing about what needs to be improved before the next match:

Chuuni wants to improve the weapons.

Gutsy wants more mobility.


Siding with one will improve your relationship with them and hurt your

relationship with the other. Also improving the tank's movement speed or firing rate.
