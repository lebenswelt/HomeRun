Abstract:

An unconventional Otome game that follows the RoboMaster's storyline.

A student is drafted into a school's new robotics club. 

They meet the other students in the club, form bonds,

friends, enemies, and eventually take part in a local 

robotics tournament.

---

Decision Branching follows a path that yields "upgrades" 

e.g.

Chuuni and Gutsy are arguing about what needs to be improved before the next match:

Chuuni wants to improve the weapons.

Gutsy wants more mobility.


Siding with one will improve your relationship with them and hurt your

relationship with the other. Also improving the tank's movement speed or firing rate.

Intro
You've missed the first day of school. On the second day, you learn 
The school is making a robotics club mandatory (for funding)
A minimum number of members must be met so other clubs have been forced to volunteer members.
your club picked you since you were absent.
You arrive at the clubroom to meet the teacher. He gives you a crash course in robot fighting before the other members arrive.
He explains that Robom*sters has different formats. The budget only allows for the smallest format, 1v1.
The other members arrive, jovial.
The teacher explains how he'll be available for technical questions but pretty much it's in your collective hands.
